# HelloWorld Web Application

This is a quite simple demo, which shows how to use Winter Framework to build a web application.

You can use command `mvn clean package -pl winter-webapp-helloworld -am -DskipTests=true` 
to build the webapp which is a war format, and then deploy it to a servlet container like Tomcat.
**(Notes: Run this command in the root directory of the project)**

Requirements:
 - tomcat 10 or higher
